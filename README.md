Icescrum Task Creator

This firefox extension is to be used with the Icescrum to create tasks while keeping the same scrollbar position. Also, I created a batch mode that can be used by double clicking a story.

Another thing is that you need put customize your toolbar. We do not change it and don't forget to open the eyes :)
