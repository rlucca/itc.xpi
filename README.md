Icescrum Task Creator

This firefox extension is to be used with the Icescrum to create tasks while keeping the same position. I wasn't able to keep the same location to allow multiple task creation, but the user can always click to force open a new tab as workaround.

Another thing is that you need put customize your toolbar. We do not change it.
