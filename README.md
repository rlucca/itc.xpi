Icescrum Task Creator

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/rlucca/itc.xpi/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/rlucca/itc.xpi)

This firefox extension is to be used with the Icescrum to create tasks while keeping the same scrollbar position. Also, I created a batch mode that can be used by double clicking a story.

Another thing is that you need put customize your toolbar. We do not change it and don't forget to open the eyes :)
